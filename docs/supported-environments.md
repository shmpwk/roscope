## ROS 2 distributions

| Distribution | Ubuntu | Status |

| Humble Hawksbill | 22.04 | Supported |
| Jazzy Jalisco | 24.04 | Supported |
| Rolling | 24.04 | Should work (untested in CI) |

A sourced ROS 2 environment is expected.  While the resolver does not link against
any ROS 2 libraries, it relies on `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH` to locate installed ROS
packages (e.g. buildfarm packages like `rosbridge_server` or `tf2_ros`).  Source
your ROS 2 setup file (`source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash`) before running
roscope.

## Python

- **Python 3.10+** required (for evaluating Python launch files and `$(eval ...)`
  substitutions in XML launch files)
- Must be available as `python3` in `PATH`
- **PyYAML** (`python3-yaml`) must be installed — the Python resolver imports it
  to parse parameter files in OpaqueFunction bodies
- No ROS 2 Python packages needed on the resolver host

## External executables

roscope shells out to several external tools.  Not all are required for every
command — the table below shows which tools are needed and when.

| Executable | Required for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git` | All commands | Sparse-checkout, ls-remote, archive |
| `python3` | `resolve`, `build`, `check`, `test` | Evaluating Python launch files and `$(eval ...)` |
| `colcon` | `build`, `test` | Build orchestration; **planned to be replaceable** |
| `rosdep` | `--rosdep` flag only | System dependency resolution; **planned to be replaceable** |
| `apt-get` | `--rosdep` with `#apt` deps | Called via `sudo` |
| `pip` | `--rosdep` with `#pip` deps | Called with `--break-system-packages` |

**Planned changes:** `colcon` and `rosdep` are currently invoked as subprocesses,
but we plan to support alternative build backends and dependency resolvers in
the future, reducing the number of external dependencies.

## Launch file support

### XML launch files (`*.launch.xml`)

Fully supported.  All standard ROS 2 XML launch constructs are handled:

- `<node>`, `<composable_node>`, `<load_composable_node>`
- `<include>` with argument forwarding
- `<group>` with scoping and `<push-ros-namespace>`
- `<arg>`, `<let>`, `<set_env>`, `<unset_env>`
- `if=` / `unless=` conditional attributes
- Substitutions: `$(var)`, `$(find-pkg-share)`, `$(find-pkg-prefix)`,
  `$(env)`, `$(eval)`, `$(dirname)`

### Python launch files (`*.launch.py`)

Supported via shimmed imports.  Standard patterns work:

- `generate_launch_description()` entry point
- `Node`, `LifecycleNode`, `ComposableNodeContainer`, `LoadComposableNodes`
- `IncludeLaunchDescription` with `PythonLaunchDescriptionSource` and
  `AnyLaunchDescriptionSource`
- `DeclareLaunchArgument`, `LaunchConfiguration`
- `GroupAction`, `PushROSNamespace`
- `OpaqueFunction`
- `FindPackageShare`, `PathJoinSubstitution`
- Conditions: `IfCondition`, `UnlessCondition`, `LaunchConfigurationEquals`
- Event handlers: `OnProcessExit`, `OnProcessStart`, etc.
- `EmitEvent` and other built-in event actions

**Lifecycle and event handling caveats:**  `LifecycleNode` is captured by the
shim and appears as a `<lifecycle_node>` element in the resolved XML.
`OnProcessExit`, `OnProcessStart`, etc. similarly produce XML elements when
visited directly.  `RegisterEventHandler` is a no-op — it emits a warning and
produces no resolved output (see [Event handler callbacks](#event-handler-callbacks)
below).  Additional caveats:

- There is currently **no executor that recognizes these extended XML elements**.
  The resolved output preserves the structure for inspection, but `ros2 launch`
  does not understand `<lifecycle_node>` or `<on_process_exit>` tags in XML.
- Event handler **callbacks have very limited support**: built-in actions like
  `EmitEvent` are supported, but arbitrary Python function callbacks are not —
  they cannot be serialized to XML.

### YAML launch files (`*.launch.yaml`)

Supported via the YAML parser.

### Xacro (`*.xacro`, `*.urdf.xacro`)

**Not supported.**  Xacro files are not launch files — they are XML macro
templates for URDF/SDF robot descriptions.  When an XML launch file references
xacro (e.g. via a `$(xacro ...)` substitution), the xacro call is preserved
in the resolved output but not executed by roscope — the actual xacro
expansion happens at runtime when the system is launched.

Python-side xacro calls (e.g. `xacro.process_file()` in an OpaqueFunction)
are not supported and will fail, since the `xacro` package is not available
through the resolver's shimmed imports.

## Known limitations

### `get_package_share_directory()` in preview mode

`get_package_share_directory()` (from `ament_index_python`) looks up installed
packages via `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH`.  In **preview mode** (`--preview`), source
packages have not been built or installed yet, so the call will fail with a
`PackageNotFoundError` for any package that exists only in the source tree.

**Recommended replacement:** use the `FindPackageShare` substitution instead.
`FindPackageShare` is resolved by roscope itself: in preview mode it points
to the package's source directory (when the package is present in the lockfile
source tree); after a build it points to the install directory.

```python
# Instead of:
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
pkg_share = get_package_share_directory("my_pkg")

# Use:
from launch_ros.substitutions import FindPackageShare
from launch.substitutions import PathJoinSubstitution
pkg_share = FindPackageShare("my_pkg")
config = PathJoinSubstitution([pkg_share, "config", "params.yaml"])
```

If a string path is required, move the affected logic into an `OpaqueFunction`
and call `FindPackageShare("my_pkg").perform(context)` there.  The launch
context is available inside `OpaqueFunction`, and `FindPackageShare` resolves
correctly in both preview and post-build mode.  Any actions that depend on the
string must also be constructed and returned from within the function:

```python
import os
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import OpaqueFunction
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch_ros.substitutions import FindPackageShare

def generate_launch_description():
    def setup(context, *args, **kwargs):
        pkg_share = FindPackageShare("my_pkg").perform(context)
        config = os.path.join(pkg_share, "config", "params.yaml")
        return [
            Node(
                package="my_pkg",
                executable="my_node",
                parameters=[config],
            )
        ]

    return LaunchDescription([OpaqueFunction(function=setup)])
```

> **Note:** This is the most general migration pattern, but many simple cases
> do not require `OpaqueFunction` at all.  In the example above, the
> `parameters` argument of `Node` accepts substitutions directly, so
> `PathJoinSubstitution([FindPackageShare("my_pkg"), "config", "params.yaml"])`
> would suffice without performing any substitution manually.  Reserve
> `OpaqueFunction` for cases where a plain string is genuinely required by a
> context that does not accept substitutions.

**Source/install path assumption:** roscope assumes that any resource file
referenced by path in a launch file (launcher files, parameter files, etc.) is
present at the **same relative path within the package share directory** in both
the source tree and the install tree, and that the file contents are identical.
This is the standard ROS 2 convention (resources are installed via CMake
`install(DIRECTORY ...)` rules).  Resources that are generated or transformed
during the build (e.g. files processed by `configure_file`) may not satisfy
this assumption.

### OpaqueFunction constraints

`OpaqueFunction` bodies are executed directly, not just analyzed.  They may fail when:
- The function performs network I/O or other side effects
- The function imports non-standard packages not available on the resolver host
- The function modifies global state that affects other launch actions
- The function calls `get_package_share_directory()` in preview mode (see above)

### stdout in Python launch files

Any `print()` output in Python launch files (including inside `OpaqueFunction`
bodies) is redirected to stderr.  This is because the resolver writes resolved
XML to stdout — any extraneous output would corrupt the result.

### Conditional dependencies (REP-149)

`package.xml` condition attributes (e.g.
`<depend condition="$ROS_DISTRO == humble">pkg</depend>`) are evaluated using
the current environment.  If `ROS_DISTRO` is not set, conditional dependencies
are excluded.

### Single-machine resolution

The resolver runs on a single machine and produces output for that machine's
architecture and ROS distribution.  Cross-distribution resolution (e.g.
resolving a Humble launch file on a Jazzy host) is not supported.

### Custom `Action` and `Substitution` extensions

Third-party `Action` or `Substitution` subclasses defined outside the standard
`launch` / `launch_ros` packages are not resolved.  roscope's resolver only
covers the closed vocabulary of the standard API.

In **XML launch files**, unknown elements are skipped with a warning and
resolution continues.

In **Python launch files**, the failure mode depends on where the unknown type
appears:

- **Top-level import or attribute access on a shim module** — the shim's
  `__getattr__` hook intercepts the lookup and returns a no-op stub with a
  warning, so resolution continues.  The stub is an `Action` subclass that
  produces no resolved output; topology that depends on it will be absent.
- **Import of a package entirely outside the shim** (e.g. a third-party
  library) — raises `ImportError`, causing resolution of the entire file to
  fail.  All topology from that file is lost.
- **Inside an `OpaqueFunction` body** — the function raises on import or
  instantiation; the function's return value is discarded and an error is
  logged, but resolution continues.  Only the topology fragment that function
  would have produced is lost.
- **Unknown action type returned by `OpaqueFunction`** — rejected with
  `"expected Action, got ..."` and dropped from the resolved output.

### `$(command ...)` substitution

The `$(command ...)` substitution executes a shell command and substitutes its
output.  roscope does not execute the command; it preserves the literal
`$(command ...)` expression in the resolved output.  A warning is emitted
whenever this substitution is encountered, because an unresolved value in a
conditional attribute or path component may cause incorrect topology analysis.
The only known call site in Autoware is xacro invocations — the resulting
unresolved substitution is visible in the resolved XML.

### `ExecutableInPackage` substitution

`ExecutableInPackage` / `$(exec-in-pkg <executable> <package>)` locates an
executable in a package's libexec directory (`<prefix>/lib/<package>/`).
roscope implements this substitution with mode-dependent behavior:

- **Preview mode** — the install tree is not available before `colcon build`,
  so the path cannot be resolved.  The package is still tracked, a warning is
  emitted, and the literal `$(exec-in-pkg ...)` expression is preserved in the
  resolved output (same approach as `$(command ...)`).
- **Post-build mode** — resolves the executable path from `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH`
  using the same logic as the official implementation: locate the package prefix
  via the AMENT index, then find the executable in `<prefix>/lib/<package>/`.

### Event handler callbacks

Event handlers (`RegisterEventHandler`, `OnProcessExit`, `OnProcessStart`,
etc.) are a **Python launch file construct only** — XML launch files have no
event handler syntax.

In Python launch files, `RegisterEventHandler` is shimmed as a no-op: when
encountered, a warning is emitted and no resolved output is produced.  Event
handlers are effectively invisible in the resolved graph.  This is a known gap;
event-handler-driven topology changes will not appear in the output.

### Incomplete coverage of standard types

The current implementation covers the subset of standard `Action` and
`Substitution` types needed to resolve Autoware launch files.  Some types in
the standard `launch` / `launch_ros` API are not yet implemented.  In XML
launch files, unrecognized elements are skipped with a warning.  In Python
launch files, accessing an unimplemented attribute on a shim module
(`launch.actions`, `launch_ros.actions`, `launch.substitutions`,
`launch_ros.substitutions`) returns a no-op stub with a warning — resolution
continues but topology that depends on the missing type will be absent.
Importing a package that is entirely outside the shim (a third-party library)
still raises `ImportError` and fails the file.  The complete coverage list will
be finalized alongside the formal operational semantics work.

## Assumptions

- **vcstool `.repos` format** — roscope reads standard `.repos` files.
  Other manifest formats (rosinstall, wstool) are not supported.
- **Standard package layout** — packages must have a `package.xml` at their root.
  Non-standard layouts (e.g. nested packages without a top-level `package.xml`)
  may not be detected during indexing.
- **colcon as build tool** — the `build` command invokes `colcon build`.  Other
  build tools (catkin_make, catkin_tools) are not supported.
- **Git repositories** — only git repos are supported in `.repos` files.
  Subversion, Mercurial, etc. are not handled.
